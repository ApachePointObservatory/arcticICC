CCD is 4096x4096 but 100 pixels of pre-and-post scan are read, in unbinned mode

Caveats
- It is only possible to subwindow if reading out the whole CCD from a single amplifier
- When using all amps the data must have an even number of columns and rows
- Do NOT send commands to the Leach timer board during readout. That will suspend readout. Read about it in the CRD command in the CommandDescription.

TO DO:
- Disallow non-even row or column length when reading all amplifiers (as occurs for bin=3x3 and 4x4, for instance)
- Write FITS header info for data and bias region(s); this depends on whether we are reading 1 or 4 amps
- Perhaps take shutter delay into account when predicting duration of exposure time state

Prescan and overscan per amplifier, based on observation:
amps    bin     prescan     overscan    total
 all    1       6           44          50
 all    2       4           21          25
 all    3       forbidden: Number of COLS and ROWS must be EVEN for DEINTERLACE_CCD_QUAD
 all    4       forbidden: Number of COLS and ROWS must be EVEN for DEINTERLACE_CCD_QUAD
 1      1       6           94          100
 1      2       4           46           50
 1      3       3+1         29+1         32+2  the prescan and postsacn don't divide evenly, leading to 1 mixed pixel in each

Here are some useful direct commands:
AEX: abort exposure without reading it out (used by Expose)
ABR: abort readout
RET: read elapsed eposure time (what is returned if not exposing?)
SET: set exposure timer: issue this prior to sending SEX (used by Expose)
SEX: start an exposure (used by Expose)
PEX: pause exposure (closing shutter if need be)
REX: resume exposure (opening shutter if need be)
SSS: set subarray size (used by SetSubArray, which calls SSS first, then SSP)
    note that SSS, 0, 0, 0 resets to full frame (without calling SSP)!
SSP: set subarray position (used by SetSubArray)
WRM: set bin factor, and other things. To set bin factor:
    Command(TIM_ID, WRM, (Y_MEM | 0x5), binCols)
    Command(TIM_ID, WRM, (Y_MEM | 0x6), binRows)
OSH: open shutter
CSH: close shutter
SPS: NOT DOCUMENTED: sets the readout rate (set pixel speed?); used by Owl in SelectableReadoutSpeedCC.bsh

The reason so many API commands take full image size as an argument is that the API always checks to see if the image buffer needs to be grown. I do not plan to emulate that; as long as we specify the overscan at construction time we know that maximum image buffer size then and we never touch it.
