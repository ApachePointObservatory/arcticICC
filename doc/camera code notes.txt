CCD is 4096x4096

Notes (additions and clarifications to Leach the documentation, especially the CommandDescription manual):
- Windowing (SSS and SSP commands):
    - It is only possible to subwindow if reading out the whole CCD from a single amplifier.
    - Arguments to SSS and SSP are in binned pixels.
    - The SSP command's 3rd argument is start of overscan subregion - end of data subregion.
- When reading quad amps the data must have an even number of columns and rows.
- Do NOT send commands to the Leach timer board during readout. That will suspend readout. Read about it in the CRD command in the CommandDescription.

Rather than use the provided API directly, we will use a wrapper with these properties:
- Easier and safer to use:
    - Catch errors early. For instance the API allows setting bin factors that the deinterlacer cannot handle, and this only fails after the image is read out.
    - Set configuration in a correct and unambiguous order (avoid separate calls to set readout amps, bin factor and window, which can easily lead to an unexpected or invalid state).
    - Support RAII (resource acquisition is initialization) so that the camera is reliably acquired and given up.
    - Functions should only take that are directly relevant (avoid extra parameters, such as image dimensions, that can more easily and safely be computed).
- Add missing functionality. For instance the API does not include functions to set readout rate or readout amplifiers.
- Provide sub-windowing based on corner and dimensions rather than center and dimensions.
- Provide a python wrapper.

TO DO:
- Try to fix initial bad row when windowing (which is only present if window start row > 0). This may require a change to the DSP code.
  If this cannot be fixed then add a row when windowing (if window start row > 0) and omit it from DATASEC and BIASSEC.

Total image size and related notes:
- The x prescan is hard-coded at different bin factors (and is not trivial to predict; just measure and make a lookup table); there is no y prescan.
- The user specified the total image size (as long as it is larger than prescan + ccd pixels), so the user indirectly commands the number of overscan pixels in x and y.
- Given the difficulty of predicting prescan and the limitations of image size for quad readout, we will only support 1, 2, 3 and 4x binning.
- In order to support 3x3 binning with quad readout it is necessary to skip one row in y in order to use the center two rows of data; otherwise they end up a mix of overscan and data, and the center of the image is a lousy place for bad rows and columns. Use the SXY (skip X,Y) command for this.
- The data looks slightly nicer data if we skip two columns for single-amplifier 3x binning. Use the SXY (skip X,Y) command for this.
- We will have 2 rows of y overscan when using quad readout, to give visual separation.

*One row/col looks like valid data but with a lower gain. We will assume it is usable data (part of DATASEC),
since it can presumably be calibrated out.


Here are some useful direct commands:
AEX: abort exposure without reading it out (used by Expose)
ABR: abort readout
RET: read elapsed eposure time (what is returned if not exposing?)
SET: set exposure timer: issue this prior to sending SEX (used by Expose)
SEX: start an exposure (used by Expose)
PEX: pause exposure (closing shutter if need be)
REX: resume exposure (opening shutter if need be)
SSS: set subarray size (used by SetSubArray, which calls SSS first, then SSP)
    note that SSS, 0, 0, 0 resets to full frame (without calling SSP)!
SSP: set subarray position (used by SetSubArray)
WRM: set bin factor, and other things. To set bin factor:
    Command(TIM_ID, WRM, (Y_MEM | 0x5), binCols)
    Command(TIM_ID, WRM, (Y_MEM | 0x6), binRows)
OSH: open shutter
CSH: close shutter
SPS: NOT DOCUMENTED: set the readout rate; supported values are FST, MED, SLW; see Owl code SelectableReadoutSpeedCC.bsh
SXY: NOT DOCUMENTED (added for us): skip the specified number of columns and rows
