CCD is 4096x4096

Caveats:
- It is only possible to subwindow if reading out the whole CCD from a single amplifier.
- When using all amps the data must have an even number of columns and rows; this affects valid bin factors vs. image size
- Do NOT send commands to the Leach timer board during readout. That will suspend readout. Read about it in the CRD command in the CommandDescription.

Rather than use the provided API directly, we will use a thin wrapper with these properties:
- Easier and safer to use:
    - Catch errors early. For instance the API allows setting bin factors that the deinterlacer cannot handle, and this only fails after the image is read out.
    - Avoid the need to specify image dimensions to functions
    - Avoid the need to specify configuration parameters to functions (hard-code them or read a config file)
    - Support RAII (resource acquisition is initialization)
- Add missing functionality. For instance the API does not include functions to set readout rate or readout amplifiers
- Provide sub-windowing based on corner and dimensions rather than center and dimensions
- Provide a python wrapper

TO DO:
- Write FITS header info for data and bias region(s); this depends on whether we are reading 1 or 4 amps.
    The table of prescan and overscan below may prove helpful. From that I'm not sure I can predict
    the behavior for higher binning factor. I suspect we should just prohibit bin factor > 4.
- Perhaps take shutter delay into account when predicting duration of exposure time state

Total image size
- The x prescan is hard-coded at different bin factors (and is not trivial to predict; just measure and make a lookup table); there is no y prescan.
- The computer sets the total image size (as long as it is larger than prescan + ccd pixels), so the computer commands the number of overscan pixels in x and y.
- In order to support 1, 2, 3 and 4x binning in both directions we will use an unbinned image size of 4200x4104 pixels and limit the bin factor to a maximum of 4.

x prescan and overscan per amplifier, based on observation (in X, there is no prescan in y).
Note: at 3x3 binning the prescan, data and postscan don't divide evenly, leading to 1-pixel mixed borders between regions;
this border is included in the prescan and overscan columns (and should not be included in the biassec).

*One row/col looks like valid data but with a lower gain. For now I'm assuming it is NOT part of the DATASEC
but if it is then I would like to update the table. I'm puzzled why this row is different; the prescan
and overscan regions properly divide by the bin factor.

Here are some useful direct commands:
AEX: abort exposure without reading it out (used by Expose)
ABR: abort readout
RET: read elapsed eposure time (what is returned if not exposing?)
SET: set exposure timer: issue this prior to sending SEX (used by Expose)
SEX: start an exposure (used by Expose)
PEX: pause exposure (closing shutter if need be)
REX: resume exposure (opening shutter if need be)
SSS: set subarray size (used by SetSubArray, which calls SSS first, then SSP)
    note that SSS, 0, 0, 0 resets to full frame (without calling SSP)!
SSP: set subarray position (used by SetSubArray)
WRM: set bin factor, and other things. To set bin factor:
    Command(TIM_ID, WRM, (Y_MEM | 0x5), binCols)
    Command(TIM_ID, WRM, (Y_MEM | 0x6), binRows)
OSH: open shutter
CSH: close shutter
SPS: NOT DOCUMENTED: sets the readout rate (set pixel speed?); used by Owl in SelectableReadoutSpeedCC.bsh
