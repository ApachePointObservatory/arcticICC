CCD is 4096x4096
The controller reads out 100 extra unbinned pixels of prescan + overscan in x (and none in y):
- when reading in quad mode it reads 50 x pixels of overscan
- when reading in single-amplifier mode it reads 6 pixels (?) of prescan and 100-pre of overscan
It is only possible to subwindow if reading out the whole CCD from a single amplifier
Do NOT send commands to the Leach timer board during readout. That will suspend readout. Read about it in the CRD command in the CommandDescription.

TO DO:
- Fix the startup problem (the first few exposures are bad)
- Test setReadoutAmps, setWindow, setFullWindow and other set routines
- Fix SWIG wrapper so the camera is wrapped
- Write FITS header info for data and bias region(s); this depends on whether we are reading 1 or 4 amps
- Take shutter delay into account when predicting duration of exposure time state

Here are some useful direct commands:
AEX: abort exposure without reading it out (used by Expose)
ABR: abort readout
RET: read elapsed eposure time (what is returned if not exposing?)
SET: set exposure timer: issue this prior to sending SEX (used by Expose)
SEX: start an exposure (used by Expose)
PEX: pause exposure (closing shutter if need be)
REX: resume exposure (opening shutter if need be)
SSS: set subarray size (used by SetSubArray, which calls SSS first, then SSP)
    note that SSS, 0, 0, 0 resets to full frame (without calling SSP)!
SSP: set subarray position (used by SetSubArray)
WRM: set bin factor, and other things. To set bin factor:
    Command(TIM_ID, WRM, (Y_MEM | 0x5), binCols)
    Command(TIM_ID, WRM, (Y_MEM | 0x6), binRows)
OSH: open shutter
CSH: close shutter
SPS: NOT DOCUMENTED: sets the readout rate (set pixel speed?); used by Owl in SelectableReadoutSpeedCC.bsh

The reason so many API commands take full image size as an argument is that the API always checks to see if the image buffer needs to be grown. I do not plan to emulate that; as long as we specify the overscan at construction time we know that maximum image buffer size then and we never touch it.
